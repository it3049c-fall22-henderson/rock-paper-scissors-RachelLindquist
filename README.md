## Team Reflection:
- Where did you encounter struggles today, and what did you do to deal with it?
I had a problem with RockPaperScissors not acting like a class, instead assuming itself to be a function.
I met with the TA and found that there was 1 line of code which I needed to remove in rock_paper_scissors.js. This
fixed the problem and I was able to finish the rest of the exercise without any major issues.

### How long it took us to finish this?
Around 4 hours.
